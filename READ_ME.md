Learning Opportunities
It is highly recommended that you use the following resources to maximize your success:

“Introduction to SDN and OpenFlow (3:29:00)” from Udemy   https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/381720354
“Introduction to Cisco Automation and Software Defined Networks (1:24:00)” from Pluralsight  https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/303933736
“SDN and SD-WAN Fundamentals: Intro to Software-defined Networking (1:12:00)” from Pluralsight https://lrps.wgu.edu/provision/303938265

The layers in the OSI model and TCP/IP provide a foundation upon which a software-defined network builds. 

SDN and SDN operations including OpenFlow, network programmability, and network automation will be defined and covered. 

The benefits of automation along with automation tools will be covered. 

The frameworks for SDN and some use cases will be offered. 

Some SDN frameworks, as well as secure ways of implementing SDN configuration standards, will be covered.

"SDN is network programmability and network automation" <- define software-defined networking

SDN operations involve OpenFlow, network programmability, network automation, and virtual switching.  <- define software-defined networking operations

SDN provides opportunities for network virtualization by building and managing networks using network automation. <- identify the opportunities for automation tools to perform specific software-defined networking operations


OSI 7 layers and IETF:
interface network
internet
transport
application


There are three main components to a software-defined network: controller, applications, and devices.
Controller is the control plane


Quizes
Which OSI model layer is responsible for the segment protocol data unit?
The transport layer in the OSI model handles segments.


Which protocol in the software-defined networking (SDN) framework is responsible for defining the communication between the controller and a network device?
OpenFlow - Its a protocol used in some SDN implementations between the control and forwarding layers of an SDN architecture.

Which OpenStack unit provides authentication?
Keystone, think Keystone is they keystone for authentication for open stack

Which interface in SDN allows the controller to communicate, interact, and manage forwarding elements?
Southbound - Openflow is the common implmentation of the southbound interface


Which OpenFlow SDN controller has a multi-threaded, cross-platform, and modular emphasis?
Beacon is the Java-based OpenFlow SDN controller that employs a multi-threaded architectural design.
think beacon offers multi threads of light

Which IPv6 address identifies each network interface?
Anycast , think anycasts network interfaces

NFV - Network Functions Virtualization is the replacement of network appliance hardware with virtual machines
