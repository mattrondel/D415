### Designate used to point applications in the OpenStack environment to a trusted DNS source. Since it seeks to enhance the security in the environment, it is often Designated as straddling the management and secure functions.




## Core Modules

### Nova 
Compute module used to create and delete compute instances

### Glance
Synchronizes and maintains VM images across the compute cluster. Virtual machine image management THINK: Virtual Machine Images at a Glance

### Keystone

## Security Modules 

### Barbican

Barbican is a REST API designed for the secure storage, provisioning and management of secrets such as passwords, encryption keys and X.509 Certificates. 

Is the Key manager service it provides secure storage, provisioning and management of secret data, such as password, encryption keys, X509 Certificates and raw binary data

Should be used to improve the storage and management of secure authentication information. Works with Keystone authentication to manage internal application security by behaving as a key manager.
