## Ansible
--------------
Written in python
PUSH Method
Agentless
uses PUSH (to devices) over SSH or NETCONF (an XML file)
the PUSH is also how get the configuration from a device

-Terminolgy-
Logic      - Playbook
Device     - Inventory
Templates  - Templates - written in Jinja2
Variables  - Variables - Written in YAML



## Puppet
--------------
Written in C++, Ruby and Closure
PULL Method
Uses an agent
Uses TCP Port 8140

-Terminolgy-
Logic     - Manifest
Devices   - Resources/Class/Module
Templates - Templates
Variables - Variables


## Chef
--------------
Written in Ruby
PULL Method
Uses an agent

-Terminolgy-
Logic     - Recipe/RunList
Devices   - Resources
Templates - Cookbook
Variables - Variables


Imperative Model vs Declarative models 
-These are two ways to manage the network devices.-

Imperative 
In the past networks have traditionally been managed on a per device basis using this model
Exact steps to achieve desired end state are specified using specific procedures and configuration items
Each step each configuration each item is specified. 
Think: it is imperative that you follow everything step by step

Declarative
Admin models how they want the environment to look, and the device decide on how best to implement changes.
“The administration device says here what I’d like you to do, here’s how I’d like you to look, here’s a model of what I’d like you to be, but I’m going to go ahead and let you , the end device, decide how to best implement those changes”
Think: I declare you decide the best way to achieve the best state


CMT Tools or CMT server – CMT means Configuration management Tools.

Agent vs Agentless
Agent – the central server defines the required or intended state of the system. Agents running on the remote device use the pull method to pull down the configuration and enforce the desired state 
Chef
Puppet

Agentless 
Ansible
Salt (sometimes called Saltstack)

Puppet
Configuration management framework where agents are installed on the devices (node)
Agents regularly poll the system to constantly check the desired state and enforce configurations from the puppet server
Puppet uses Declarative model


Chef
Server stores cookbooks which are polices applied to each node 
Client agent pulls Ruby configuration from the server
Chef is written in ruby
The agent running on the client implements the recipe which is the code being deployed
Chef uses the Imperative intent based model


Ansible
Written in python
Controller defines a playbook
Controller connects to the target device(s) over ssh or api and pushes the configuation

	
Salt
Used for configuration management and also installing software on servers
Uses python
Salt nodes run client programs called minions
Agentless if remote system supports shh and python
