“SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HYPERVISOR DEPLOYMENT”

Security considerations and best practices when deploying hypervisors.  

Key highlights

Hypervisor security – securing it to prevent unauthorized access, ensure isolation between VMs and protect against attacks.

Virtualizing Components – covers various components of virtualization, including host systems, guest systems, management interfaces, and virtual network, and discuss security measures for each of these components. 

Isolation and segmentation – highlights importance of maintaining strong isolation between virtual machines to prevent unauthorized information disclosure or unauthorized access.

Configuration Management – need for secure configuration of hypervisor and virtual machine settings, including parameters related to memory allocation, CPU scheduling and network configs

Secure Deployment – recommendations for secure deployment practices, including patch management, secure boot processes and hardware-based security features.

Virtualization Vulnerabilities – Discusses potential Vulnerabilities that may rise due to virtualization, such as side-channel attacks and VM escape attacks and provides guidance on mitigating these attacks.
