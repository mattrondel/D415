SDN WGU Course notes


"Passed this course a few days ago with about 2 weeks of studying. As others have said STRONGLY recommend watching the 3 videos listed in the course material. The book isn't too long of a read but I do recommend reading that as well to supplement the videos. Know the acronyms NFV, VNF, VNFM, VNFI, CVSS. I also recommend if you have not taken CCNA or have no background in network security(firewalls) brush up on those sections in the book. NIST 800-125B, NIST 800-53 were not explained deeply in the book but I googled on my own to get a better understanding."

"Passed on my first attempt last night. As others have stated, the 3 videos in the beginning are critical as well as the reading material. I switched over from the Cloud Deployment and Operations course after failing twice, and this course was 10000x better in my opinion. I had multiple questions on OpenStack, SDN vs NFV, NIST 800-53 and 800-125b, CVSS, Southbound VS Northbound interface, and firewalls. The PA is a great indicator of how you'll do, so just review the sections you missed and you'll be fine. You got this!!!"
