"Know your acronyms (eg: NFV, VNF, VNFM, VNFI, CVSS)"
•	Name

•	What it means

•	Whats it used for 

•	Additonal question to solve


### NFV - 
Network functions virtualization 
Know any examples? – the CSR we have is this.
Virtualing network functions


### VNF – 
Virtual Network Functions
What this means – a software-based implementation of a network function (duh it’s in the name) that would be traditionally preformed by dedicated hardware appliances. VNF run on virtualized infrastructure and can deployed, managed and scaled more dynamically compared to traditional hardware-based solutions.

Know any examples? – not at this time

Google quick definition - Common VNFs include virtualized routers, firewalls, WAN optimization, and network address translation (NAT) services. Most VNFs are run in virtual machines (VMs) on common virtualization infrastructure software such as VMWare or KVM. (<- this sounds a lot like NFVs?)

## Questions to address:

•	NFV vs VNF – maybe ask chat GPT

•	Benefits and risks of SDN

•	How are NFV and SDNs related?

•	AAA vs RBAC - Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a term for a framework for controlling access to computer resources, enforcing policies and auditing usage. RBAC (Role Based Access Control) is a way that dictates how a subject can access objects.

### VNFM - 

### VNFI

•	Virtual Network Functions infratructure

### CVSS •	Free and open industry standard for assessing the severity of computer system security vulnerabilities

•	It's a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way.

•	It’s a standard framework used to asset and communicate the severity of vulnerabilities in software and systems. it assigns a numerical score to vulnerabilities based on factors like the impact, exploitability and complexity of the vulnerabilities. The CVSSS score helps organizations prioritize, their response to security vulnerabilities.

•	CVSS is an open-source framework for identifying and defining software vulnerabilities.

NFVI


Service chaining - multiple VNFs map together in a process called service chaining for seamless fully functional communication services 

## Attacks and Exploitation 

•	During the reconnaissance phase the attacker gathers information about the target electronically or physically  

•	Vulnerability is the state of being exposed to the possibility of the network being attacked

•	cyber kill chain terms:

•	There are 8 phases:

•	Phase 1: Reconnaissance

•	Phase 2: Weaponization

•	Phase 3: Delivery – happens when the attack is transmitted to the intended victim

•	Phase 4: Exploitation – occurs when an attack actually happens

•	Phase 5: Installation – happens when the attacker installs malware on the system

•	Phase 6: Command and Control – implies that once a system is compromised it has to call home to a command and control system

•	Phase 7: Actions on Objective

•	eighth step: Monetization (added
